    <h1>Java</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Java is a versatile, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It was developed by James Gosling and his
        team at Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy has made it one of the most
        popular programming languages in the world, especially for building cross-platform applications.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Java was initially developed under the project codename "Oak." It was originally designed for interactive
        television but was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. Later, it evolved into a
        platform-independent language capable of running on multiple devices.

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java applications run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine
            (JVM).</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java uses principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Features like exception handling, garbage collection, and strong type checking make
            Java robust.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Java provides a secure environment through its runtime checks and sandboxing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
        Java is widely used in various domains, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Development (using Spring, Hibernate, etc.)</li>
        <li>Mobile Development (Android applications)</li>
        <li>Enterprise Applications (banking systems, ERP solutions)</li>
        <li>Embedded Systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Code</h2>
    <pre>
    <code>
        public class HelloWorld &#123;
            public static void main(String[] args) &#123;
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                &#125;
            &#125;
    </code>
    </pre>
